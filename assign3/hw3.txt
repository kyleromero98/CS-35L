Homework Questions
1) I would hypothesize that this line was removed in order
to clean up some messy code and poor programming practices.
There are two labels for the same case which is redundant.
Removing this line was not necessary since the program would
have just fallen through in the switch statement.

2) There are two main issues with Brady's patch:
1 - If there is a program that relies on output in the
previous format, then there is a possiblity that this
program will no longer function properly.
2 - This patch assumes users use the English date format of
Month/Date/Year. This might cause confusion if people follow a
different date format such as date/month/year.

3) The file /dev/null acts as an empty file that developers
can use while testing their code. Looking at the code for
this script, I can see that this script expects the file
to contain lines. Therefore, I would expect some kind of
out of bounds error when we try to run this script on /dev/null.

This is confirmed when I ran the following command and
received the following repsponse:
$ python randline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.12/lib/python2.7/random.py",
  line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises
    IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

4) When this script is ran with python3 instead of python2
I get the following:
$ python3 randline.py /dev/null
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This issue stems from a change from python2 to python3
where python3 no longer supports tuple parameters, this
is what this is and therefore an error is thrown.
