Assignment 3 - Modifying and rewriting software

Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

I started this lab by logging into the SEASNet server (09)
and then creating this log file. Then, I downloaded Coreutils
7.6 using the 'wget' command into a directory that I created
named 'test' for the purposes of this lab. Then, I untarred
the file that I downloaded into the same directory.

I used the following commands:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I got the URL for the wget command by right clicking the link
on the specification and selecting 'Copy Link Address'.

I'm now able to enter this directory 'coreutils-7.6' and I
read through the INSTALL file to understand how I should install
coreutils. I determined that I needed to use the following command:
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/romero/CS35L/assign3/test/coreutils

This will install coreutils with the following installation prefix
this is simply for organization sake and ease of management.

I tried running the command on the 09 server, but then I kept
getting error messages such as the following:
-bash: cannot create temp file for here-document: No space left
on device

So, I switched over the the 07 server and ran the command again.
This time everything worked without errors and appeared to
configure everything properly.

Then, I entered the installation directory and entered the /bin
folder. This was located at: ~/CS35L/assign3/test/coreutils/bin
From there I was able to run the following command to exhibit
the incorrect output of ls:
./ls -l /bin/bash
The following is the output from this command:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash

Note: You can use the locale command to ensure that we are using
the en_US.UTF-8 locale and we make sure to run ls like this b/c
if we simply use the ls command located in the system path and we
want to run the ls command installed by coreutils.

We note that this output exhibits the incorrect YYYY-MM-DD
behavior.

Now we work to apply the patch, first I created a file called
'bradypatch.diff' using emacs and copied and pasted Brady's patch
into the file. Then, I studied the man page for patch and discovered
that its basically the opposite of diff. I found that I should use the
command: 'patch -p1 < bradypatch.diff'.

This applied the changes to the relevant files but now we need to
compile the files with the changes applied; we do this with the make
command. After running the make command we receive the following
response:

When we ran the make-all recursive command, the make file runs through all
of the files in this directory searching for changes since the last make.
Therefore, not all of these commands were necessary because in a lot of the
directories there weren't any changes. Therefore, the only lines that were
really necessary are lines where the output doesn't respond with 'Nothing
to be done for 'all-am''.

And now, we cd into the src directory in order to gain access to our new
version of the 'ls' command. We enter the following two commands:
cd src
./ls -l /bin/bash
And receive the following response:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 Aug  3 06:36 /bin/bash
Note: This follows the correct format and makes sense since we have
applied the patch to this version of ls.

Then, I created a new directory in my dir for this assignment and
some new test files using the following commands:
mkdir testpatch
cd testpatch
touch -t 9808071200 old
touch new

This creates a file from August 7th, 1998 (my birthday) and a new file
to test both versions of ls.

The commands I ran to test each version and their responses are as follows:
WITHOUT PATCH
Input
~/CS35L/assign3/test/coreutils/bin/ls -l
Response
-rw-r--r-- 1 romero csugrad 0 2017-10-21 18:03 new
-rw-r--r-- 1 romero csugrad 0 1998-08-07 12:00 old

WITH PATCH
Input
~/CS35L/assign3/test/coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
Response
-rw-r--r-- 1 romero csugrad 0 Oct 21 18:03 new
-rw-r--r-- 1 romero csugrad 0 Aug  7  1998 old

These tests confirm that we have successfully patched the incorrect
behavior and left the originally buggy version intact.
