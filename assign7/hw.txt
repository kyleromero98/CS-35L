Homework 7 - SSH Setup and Use in Applications

1. If the other teams had been observing every byte that went
across our network, then the connection would still be secure.
The data would be encrypted with the public and private keys
and the attackers would have the public key. However, the attackers
would not have access to the private key and so the communication
would still be considered secure because it would be extremely
hard for them to decrypt the message.

If the other teams had access to the keystrokes of my partner
and I, then they would be able to determine the password that
was used to authenticate the SSH connection between my partner
and I. This would allow the attackers to access the key and the
connection would no longer be considered secure.

If I were booting off of a USB drive and the attackers had access
to this drive, then the attacker could read the public and private
key off of the drive. This would render our connection insecure
since the attacker would be able to decrypt any messages along
that channel.

2. gpg --verify only verifies the signature with the public key,
therefore, it does not check who has created the file. This is
a problem because someone could copy your public key and then
generate some signature with it. You could fix this issue by
using the private key to generate the signature.
