Laboratory 7 - SSH Setup and Use in Applications

Setting Up/SSHing into the Board

I am doing this lab on a Mac and so I had some issues to
deal with while getting my board set up.

I first connected my board and noticed that the board was
not recognized by my Mac and did not show up as a removable
disk. In order to remedy this issue, I followed a link on Piazza
to download something:
http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnyus.joshuawise.com%2FHoRNDIS
-rel8pre2-dbg.pkg%3AnWVXptevoA9QSEAQQXuPQfiJ240&cuid=1845838

And then, I ran the following command in the terminal and then
restarted my Mac:
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext

This allowed my Mac to recognize my board and allowed me to
start installing the drivers for my board.

I followed another link on Piazza in order to install the
unsigned drivers on my system:
https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglebone-getting-started/blob
/master/Drivers/Windows/BONE_D64.exe
From this link I was able to navigate to the Mac OS driver and
install it.

After realoading the README.htm file I now see that my drivers
have been successfully reinstalled.

I can now ssh into my board using the following command from
Piazza:
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
And then I had to enter my Mac password in order to successfully
ssh into the BeagleBone board.

At this point I have successfully SSHed into the BeagleBone Board.

Accessing Wifi and Installing Software

To connect the board to wifi I used the following commands:
sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services

At this point I see the wifi access point that was set up by
Professor Eggert:
CR3760-wifi          wifi_2cf7f1066912_4352333736302d77
		     696669_managed_psk

And I continued with the following to connect:
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1066912_4352333736302d776
	    	    96669_managed_psk

And when queried I entered the following password:
3760ClassNet

And then I quite from the connmanctl using the following:
connmanctl> quit

Then, I note for my teammate that the IP address of my
BeagleBone board is 10.97.85.16 and this was found using
the command 'ifconfig'.

Then, I use the following commands to install/update the
necessary software on my board in order to complete the lab:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

After letting everything run I have successfully completed
setting up my board for this lab in accordance with the post
on Piazza and can continue following the instructions in the
lecture slides.

Actual Lab Work

First, I acquired a copy of the TA's lecture slides that
made the post on Piazza from a friend in order to make this
lab a lot less headache intensive.

To ensure that my environment was setup properly I used the
following command:
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
And this returned the proper response of:
openssh-client					install
openssh-server					install
openssh-sftp-server				install

Then I generated my public/private key pair by using the
following command:
ssh-keygen

And I pressed enter to not change the default directory
and entered my password for the key pair.

I then entered the following commands to create a user for my
my partner by using the following commands:
sudo useradd -d /home/guest -m guest
sudo passwd guest
(I made the password 'password')

Now, I needed to create a .ssh directory for my partner by using
the following commands:
cd /home/guest
sudo mkdir .ssh

Then, I needed to change the permissions of this folder in order
to allow them to access and do what they want to with that directory:
sudo chown -R guest .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Then, my partner and I were able to SSH into each other's board by
using the commands (replacing IP address in each case):
ssh-copy-id -i guest@192.168.0.52
ssh guest@192.168.0.52

After SSHing into each other's boards, we were able to confirm that
we were on each other's boards by using the command 'touch hi' to
create files called 'hi'. Then, we were able to use 'ls' to see the
file.

Like many of our classmates on Piazza, we were unable to get a shell
window or anything to show on our partner's computer because we do
not have a display for our board and kept getting errors like:
xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: %s
xterm: DISPLAY is not set
Error: GDK_BACKEND does not match available displays
