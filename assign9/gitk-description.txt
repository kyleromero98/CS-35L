Gitk Description

In the upper left there is the history window that shows the branch tree
with a graphic of merges and branches. We see the structure of the HEAD
pointer and various branches in this window.

Then in the window next to that I can see names of authors and their
respective emails for that commit.

Finally, to the right of that there is a list of dates that correspond
to the commits and authors on the left.

Below that are the list of files that are modified in that specific commit.

To the left of that in the bottom left corner we have a more detailed list
of changes in diff format and more information about the committer for this
commit.

There is also a place for the ID of the commit and we are able to search by
ID here.
