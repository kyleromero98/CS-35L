Homework 9 - Verifying and Publishing a Backported Change

1. Done.

2. I reused the 'diffutils-3.0' version from the lab when doing this
homework. Once I navigatee to that directory I typed the following:
'git checkout -b quote'

3. In order to patch this version I used the command:
'patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt'

4. I first opened a file in emacs and examined how the changelog function
works. I ran emacs inside of the diffutils-3.0 folder and then used the
command C-x 4 a to get open a changelog.

This made me realize how the function worked and so I was able to continue
onto the next step.

5. I first used my file 'git-log.txt' from the lab to find the changelog
entry for the original patch.

Then, I created a changelog using 'touch ChangeLog' inside of the
diffutils-3.0 directory and then opened each of the six files that have
been modified using 'git status' and edited the Changelog entry for that
file using C-x 4 a.

I used the messages from the original patch to come up with the messages
for this patch.

6. I then added the ChangLog and committed the ChangeLog using the
following two commands:
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

7. I was then able to generate the file 'formatted-patch.txt' using the
following command:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt

8. My partner for this part of the lab was Jair Hinojosa. We used the scp
command to get copies of each other's formatted-patch.txt

I saved this into a file named partner-patch.txt and then I used the
following commands to get a new version of diffutils and apply my partner's
patch:
git checkout v3.0 -b partner
git am < ../partner-patch.txt

I then proceeded to build the patched code by doing to following:
./bootstrap
Applying the additional patch in accordance with the specification
./configure
make
make check

This ran fine and didn't have any major errors.

9. I then ran the command 'make distdir' and inspected the resulting
ChangeLog file inside of the diffutils-3.0.1-90c0 that was just made.

This contained the following changelog entry created by my partner:

2017-12-03 Jair Hinojosa <jair@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>
      * src/util.c: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

      * src/sdiff.c: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

      * src/dir.c: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

      * src/diff3.c: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

      * src/diff.c: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

      * src/cmp.c: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'



10. I then installed XQuartz for Mac and found the merge that was
required for the screenshot. I took my screenshot and placed my
description in 'gitk-description.txt'
